Here's the story of the founders and our vision below. To see more practical things on how Sendforsign 
can help you, jump to this [page](/introduction).

Hi, this is [Ilia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibillidi/), [Kate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekabovk/) and 
[Pasha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavelzhukov87/), the founders of Sendforsign. We initially embarked on this 
project as a side venture in Autumn 2023 while developing another tool. However, this side project 
became increasingly popular, with people using it to send and sign their documents. So, here we are, 
working on another API-first AI-powered contract tool.

The concept behind Sendforsign is straightforward. We believe that digital contracts are kinda broken.

Perhaps you require the integration of a contract workflow into your business processes. This often involves 
navigating demo requests, dealing with customer service managers, exploring personal pricing plans, and dedicating 
weeks and months to implementation.

How do we know this? We've previously worked on building Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) systems and integrating 
contract workflows into businesses.

But there's a bigger picture here. We're living in an era of rapid AI advancement and the emergence of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers 
that are fundamentally changing how software interacts. Contracts, as the foundation of business relationships, should 
be at the forefront of this technological evolution. They need to adapt to new capabilities, integrate seamlessly with 
AI assistants, and leverage the power of protocol-based architectures.

Instead of contracts being rigid, isolated systems, they should become intelligent, programmable components that can be 
generated, analyzed, and managed through AI-driven workflows. They should integrate naturally with MCP servers, allowing 
developers and businesses to automate contract processes with unprecedented ease and sophistication.

So, we decided that our solution will be simple: we offer "zero-setup" interfaces for straightforward cases and an 
easy-to-use Contract API for more complex scenarios, built from the ground up with AI and modern protocols in mind.

We hope you'll find it valuable.
