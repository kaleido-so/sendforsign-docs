Talk to anyone on our team, and you'll quickly discover that the most exciting part of the AI era for us isn't just that it can assist you in a more human-like way.

It's that AI can handle unstructured data in unprecedented ways. We firmly believe that AI-as-a-backend has the potential to achieve extraordinary results in the coming yearsâ€”especially when integrated with your company's repositories, APIs, and other tools.

Given our focus on contract management and eSign API, have you ever dreamed of an assistant that:

knows everything about your company 

AND 

understands all your business information about clients, employees, etc 

AND 

has access to your documents, templates, and operational processes 

AND 

can seamlessly manage workflows from start to finish?

We haveâ€”and we're building it.

This is exactly how AI should fit into our lives and work: as a backend powering everything you do at work and in daily life.
