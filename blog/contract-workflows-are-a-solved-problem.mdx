People talk about how contract workflows are a solved problem. That everyone just integrates DocuSign and moves on. I don't think so.

Most platforms duct tape together some external e-signature tool and call it a day. But the truth is, the experience is often clunky. It breaks the user journey, it slows down monetization, and it pushes value *away* from your product. You're sending revenue and control to someone else's ecosystem.

The idea that "contracts = DocuSign" feels outdated. Especially when better infrastructure exists.

I don't think external integrations are going away. But I *do* believe embedded contract infrastructure will raise the floor. That it'll give more product teams the ability to own this part of the journey. And hopefully, it'll free up time and resources for better onboarding, better UX, better everything.

A few things we've seen:

**Embedded contracts are a skill multiplier.**

Instead of spending months on internal dev or wrangling third-party APIs, platforms can just plug in native contract flows. No external accounts, no external brands, no extra tabs. It makes your platform feel more powerful, more seamless—because it actually is.

**Rethinking monetization.**

External services drain revenue. Embedded infrastructure flips that. Now every signature, every document, every contract becomes a monetizable feature *within* your platform. The resale potential is real, and it compounds.

**UX shouldn't stop at the contract.**

You work hard to craft a beautiful product experience… and then ship users off to someone else's domain to sign something? Embedded contracts let you keep the entire journey in one place. More control, better data, better design.

**The hard part is still conceptual.**

How do contracts fit into your flow? What triggers them? Who signs when? Where does the data go next? That thinking still needs to come from you. But now you don't need to build the infrastructure. Just bring the vision.

So yes—contract workflows will get faster. Easier. More native. And maybe that'll raise the baseline for how polished, efficient, and profitable this part of the product can be.
