While we've been concentrating on artificial intelligence recently, we view it strictly as a practical tool: how can it enhance the capabilities of our embedded components and infrastructure?

If there's an operation that can be accelerated using AI, we implement it.

For instance, if you need to generate a contract with a large volume of data, we aim to make it as simple as sending our infrastructure a description or a prompt, which is then automatically transformed into a sequence of API requests on our side.

This eliminates the need for developers to send numerous individual requests manually.

We're focused on three key areas:

**1️⃣ API Infrastructure**

Our API requests are designed to be embedded into your product in just a few hours for straightforward use cases.

For example, if your product requires the ability to upload a PDF, format it as a contract, send it for signing, and then return it to your user, this functionality can be integrated swiftly using our APIs.

We provide detailed documentation for every scenario, and we've recently launched a YouTube channel to gradually showcase these use cases.

**2️⃣ Integration-Accelerating Components**

We've developed a suite of components such as:

• Contract Editor

• Template Editor

• Timeline (a chronology tracker)

If you want to integrate features like contract signing even faster, our ready-made components can help. These components are already built on our APIs and can be added to your application with just a few lines of code.

This allows you to embed core functionality directly into your app, enabling users to work with PDFs or Word contracts within your interface seamlessly.

**3️⃣ AI-Powered Agent**

We're also developing AI-based agents that can be embedded into your product. These agents allow your users to interact with contracts directly using out-of-the-box solutions.

If you're looking to integrate contract management into your application and offer users AI tools to work with their contracts, our agents are designed to fit right in as standalone components.

Each agent operates independently for each of your clients, ensuring there's no overlap between them at the infrastructure level.
