## The Concept

When you add recipients to the documents created in Sendforsign, each recipient receives their personalized public sharing 
links, through which they can access the documents. Typically, the 
links look like this: 

`https://app.sendforsign.com/sharing/8269-4d32-4716-86d3-159a9cad`.

However, in some cases, you might want to change the branding of this link and replace the `sendforsign.com` domain 
with your own domain, so the links for your customers will look like this: 

`https://yourdomain.com/sharing/8269-4d32-4716-86d3-159a9cad`.

## Go to your domain provider dashboard

To enable your own domain, you will need access to your domain name provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, or any other provider you use). Please contact your web administrator to get an overview of how to access your domain name dashboard.

Below, we will provide an overview of this process based on the Namecheap account; contact your web administrator to go through the process on any other provider.

1. Once you get into your dashboard, you need to find your domain list.

2. Go to the domain page, and navigate to the DNS settings of this specific domain.

## Create a new CNAME record

Now it's time to add a new CNAME record to your DNS settings. We always recommend using a subdomain for these purposes, such as `document.yourdomain.com` or `contract.yourdomain.com`. 

Let's create a new CNAME record for a `document.` subdomain. 

1. Press `ADD NEW RECORD`.

</Frame>

2. Select:

- Type: CNAME
- Host: document
- Value or Target: paste the value you receive from the Sendforsign team
- TTL: Automatic

<Frame caption="CNAME record">
  <img src="/usecase/img/12.png" />
</Frame>

That's it; all changes will populate within the next 48 hours.

Now, any recipient link for your account will be transformed into the following structure: `document.yourdomain.com` + `sharing` + `recipientKey`.

Example: `https://document.yourdomain.com/sharing/8269-4d32-4716-86d3-159a9cad`.
