## Set up your account

Before using dynamic placeholders, see the [First document use case](/usecase/firstdoc) to set up your 
platform account and get the API key.

## Create your document

SFS provides you with two ways of creating documents: by using an API request (API way) or via our React UI (visual way). 
Let's create a simple document using our API.

To do this, you can use this request. [Learn more here.](/api-reference/contract/create-fill)

```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.sendforsign.com/api/contract' \
     -H 'X-Sendforsign-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
    "data": {
        "action": "create",
        "clientKey": "CLIENT_KEY",
        "contract": {
            "name": "New contract",
            "value": "<p>Contract text</p>"
        }
    }
}'
```

As a response, you will receive a Contract Key:

```bash json
{
    "contract": {
        "createTime": "2024-03-07T15:18:41.000Z",
        "contractKey": "d29b3893-826c-47d0-abdd-c6ed2b691a5c"
    },
    "code": "201",
    "message": "Contract created"
}
```

## Add a placeholder to your document

First, you need to add a regular placeholder to your document. This placeholder will later be converted into a dynamic table.

[Learn more about creating placeholders here.](/api-reference/placeholder/create)

```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.sendforsign.com/api/placeholder' \
     -H 'X-Sendforsign-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
    "data": {
        "action": "create",
        "clientKey": "CLIENT_KEY",
        "contractKey": "CONTRACT_KEY",
        "placeholder": {
            "name": "Product Table",
            "value": "Products will be displayed here"
        }
    }
}'
```

As a response, you will receive a Placeholder Key:

```bash json
{
    "placeholder": {
        "id": "3",
        "createTime": "2024-11-22T11:11:24.000Z",
        "changeTime": "2024-11-22T11:11:24.000Z",
        "name": "Product Table",
        "value": "Products will be displayed here",
        "type": "1",
        "placeholderKey": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
        "position": "3"
    },
    "code": 201,
    "message": "Placeholder created"
}
```

## Convert the placeholder into a dynamic table

Now that you have a placeholder with a placeholder key, you can convert it into a dynamic table. The table will replace the placeholder in your document and display structured data with columns and rows.

[Learn more about table placeholders here.](/api-reference/placeholder/update-table)

```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.sendforsign.com/api/placeholder' \
     -H 'X-Sendforsign-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
    "data": {
        "action": "update",
        "clientKey": "CLIENT_KEY",
        "contractKey": "CONTRACT_KEY",
        "placeholder": {
            "placeholderKey": "PLACEHOLDER_KEY",
            "table": {
                "columns": ["Product", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Total"],
                "rows": [
                    ["Product 1", 2, 100, 200],
                    ["Product 2", 1, 250, 250],
                    ["Product 3", 4, 75, 300]
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

As a response, you will receive confirmation that the placeholder has been updated to a table:

```bash json
{
    "placeholder": {
        "id": "3",
        "createTime": "2024-11-22T11:11:24.000Z",
        "changeTime": "2024-11-22T11:28:23.000Z",
        "name": "Product Table",
        "value": "{\"columns\":[\"Product\",\"Quantity\",\"Unit Price\",\"Total\"],\"rows\":[[\"Product 1\",2,100,200],[\"Product 2\",1,250,250],[\"Product 3\",4,75,300]]}",
        "isTable": true,
        "type": "1",
        "placeholderKey": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
        "position": "3",
        "fillingType": "1",
        "externalRecipientKey": null
    },
    "code": 201,
    "message": "Placeholder updated"
}
```

Notice that the `isTable` property is now set to `true`, and the `value` contains a JSON string with the table structure including columns and rows.

## View your document with the dynamic table

Awesome! You've successfully added a dynamic table placeholder to your document. To view the document with the table, 
use the [Contract Editor](/sdk/components/contracteditor) component and enter the Contract Key you've used 
as a `contractKey` property for the component.

The table will be displayed in your document at the position where the placeholder was originally placed. The table 
will show all your columns and rows with proper formatting, making it easy for recipients to view structured data 
like product lists, pricing information, or any other tabular content.

## Understanding table structure

When creating a dynamic table, you need to provide:

- **Columns**: An array of strings that define the column headers (e.g., `["Product", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Total"]`)
- **Rows**: An array of arrays, where each inner array represents a row with values corresponding to the columns. Values can be strings or numbers (e.g., `[["Product 1", 2, 100, 200], ["Product 2", 1, 250, 250]]`)

The number of values in each row should match the number of columns you've defined. This ensures the table displays correctly.

## Updating table data

You can update the table data at any time by making the same update request with new `columns` and `rows` values. The table 
will be updated in the document, and if the document has already been sent to recipients, they will see the updated table 
when they access the document.
