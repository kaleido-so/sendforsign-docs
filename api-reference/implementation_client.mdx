SFS offers two methods for platforms to smoothly integrate their applications with SFS services:

- React Components:
    - The SFS React UI SDK is a collection of pre-made React components linked to the API, suitable for 
    React-based client and server-side applications. This option lets you maintain control over the design and 
    branding while SFS manages the more complex tasks.
- API Only:
    - With API-only integration, platforms interact with SFS services by sending direct requests to SFS servers 
    using the provided API endpoints. This method offers full control over your integration process, enabling you to 
    implement necessary API calls within your application. It allows you the freedom to manage your backend logic while 
    utilizing the services offered by SFS.
