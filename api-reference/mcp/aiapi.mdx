### Concept

We provide our users with the ability to simplify the API request structure, sending unified requests 
to Sendforsign's infrastructure and receiving unified responses.

Supported use cases:
- `Create a contract in a free format`: Ask the system to generate a contract using your context and best practices.
- `Create a contract from a template TemplateName`: Ask the system to generate a contract using a template.
- `Fill in the template`: Provide the information needed to fill in the template.
- `Specify recipients`: Ask the system to add recipients when creating a contract.
- `See the list of templates`: Retrieve a list of templates created in your account.
- `See the list of template placeholders`: Understand how to fill in the template.

### Body parameters

  Your message.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="output" type="string">
  The response message. If the system creates a contract, the public URL to access this contract will be returned.
</ResponseField>
