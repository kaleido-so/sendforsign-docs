### Concept

We provide our users with the ability to simplify the API request structure, sending unified requests 
to Sendforsign's infrastructure and receiving unified responses.

Supported use cases:
- `Create a contract in free format`: Ask the system to generate a contract using your context and best practices. Optionally, specify the recipients' names and email addresses.
- `Create a contract from a template`: Ask the system to generate a contract using a template. Specify the name of the template.
- `Create and fill in a contract from a template`: Provide the template name, the recipients' names and email addresses, and the data to populate the placeholders.
- `See the list of templates`: Retrieve a list of templates created in your account.
- `See the list of template placeholders`: Understand how to correctly fill in the template.
