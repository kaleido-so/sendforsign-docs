To summarize, setting up involves two main steps: first, establishing the server side, which includes creating a 
Platform user, a Client, and optionally Client users. After that, you move on to setting up the client side, where 
you can either use the SFS API or React components, the latter being a more straightforward approach for starting with SFS.

## Server Side

From the server side perspective, you need to create several fundamental objects:

- Generate a platform access key (representing your platform).
- Create a client for each business that use your platform.
- Create client users for each end-user of the businesses on your platform.
- Generate a user key for each user.

Once these steps are completed, you can proceed to the client side setup.

## Client Side

SFS offers two methods for platforms to smoothly integrate their applications with SFS services:

- React Components:
    - The SFS React UI SDK is a collection of pre-made React components linked to the API, suitable for 
    React-based client and server-side applications. This option lets you maintain control over the design and 
    branding while SFS manages the more complex tasks.
- API Only:
    - With API-only integration, platforms interact with SFS services by sending direct requests to SFS servers 
    using the provided API endpoints. This method offers full control over your integration process, enabling you to 
    implement necessary API calls within your application. It allows you the freedom to manage your backend logic while 
    utilizing the services offered by SFS.
