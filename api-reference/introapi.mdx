<Note>
The Sendforsign API is currently in a **closed beta** phase. Please press the Get Demo button on the [main page](https://sendforsign.com/) to learn 
more about the capabilities of our API and request access to try it out in action.
</Note>

## Base URL

Our API is organized around **REST**. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs. We enforce HTTPS in every request 
to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All requests contain the following base URL:
```bash
https://api.sendforsign.com/api
```

## Authentication

The Sendforsign API uses API keys to authenticate requests. 
You can view and manage your API keys in the Sendforsign Dashboard.

Test mode secret keys have the prefix **sfs_test_** and live mode secret keys have 
the prefix **sfs_live_**. 

```bash
const Sendforsign = require('sendforsign');
const sendforsign = new Sendforsign('sfs_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc');
```


## Response 
Sendforsign uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, 
and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.
