## Base URL

Our API is organized around **REST**. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs. We enforce HTTPS in every request 
to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All requests contain the following base URL:
```bash
https://api.sendforsign.com/api
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an X-Sendforsign-Key header with the contents of the header 
being `YOUR_API` where `YOUR_API` is your API key.
```bash
X-Sendforsign-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Response 
Sendforsign uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, 
and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.
