Before uploading a PDF, you need to create an empty contract and obtain its ContractKey. 
To do this, use the [Create Contract](/api-reference/contract/create) 
request with the parameter `"contractType": "pdf"`.

Here's an example:
```bash cURL
{
    "data": {
        "action": "create",
        "contract": {
            "name": "Your PDF name",
            "contractType": "pdf"
        }
    }
}
```

As a response, you'll receive a ContractKey for the contract you created. 
Use this key to upload your PDF to Sendforsign's infrastructure.

Additionally, you will need to include FormData in the body of the request. 

For example:

```bash cURL
formData.append('pdf', new Blob([pdfFile as BlobPart], {type: 'application/pdf'})) 
```

Where `pdfFile` is the ArrayBuffer of your document.

### Body parameters

<ParamField body="contractKey" type="string" required>
  ID of the contract.
</ParamField>
