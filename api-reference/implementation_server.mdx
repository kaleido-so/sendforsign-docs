No matter what integration type you will choose for your Client-side implementation, there are some 
certain steps that can be only implemented on your backend. Please note that this tutorial shows code snippets 
for each step in JSON, while the exact implementation depends on the programming language and framework you use 
for your server side.

## Server Side

From the server side perspective, you need to create several fundamental objects:

- Get a platform API key and Secret key (representing your platform).
- Generate a platform token.
- Create a client for each business that use your platform.
- Generate client tokens.
- Create client users for each end-user of the businesses on your platform.

## Get a platform API key and Secret key

To begin using Sendforsign and gain the capability to generate documents through our infrastructure, 
you need to create your SFS account. Creating a new account will automatically generate a unique API key and Secret key for you.

## Generate a platform token

To create a new token for accessing the SFS API, first you need to call `POST /api/token` with the request body 
containing the `apiKey` and `secretKey` values you obtained in the previous step.

The `/api/token` endpoint does not require any authentication headers, which is in line with the OAuth 2.0 standard. 
At the same time, we strongly recommend that you pass the `X-Sendforsign-Version` HTTP header to specify the API 
version in use. This is important because the payload structure of `/api/token` might change in future API versions.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.sendforsign.com/api/token' \
     -H 'X-Sendforsign-Version: 2024-02-15' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
         "data": {
            "action": "create",
            "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
            "secret": "YOUR_SECRET"
         }
}'
```

<Note>Never store your client secret in plain text. Always treat it in a way you treat 
any other passwords and API keys in your system, and use a special encrypted storage for this type of sensitive data.</Note>

The successful `201 Created` response contains the `access_token` and its validity time (in seconds):

```bash JSON
{
  "access_token": "123456789...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800
}
```

## Handle platform token expiry

A partner token is valid only for 1800 seconds (which is 30 minutes). If you will make a request with an expired token, 
SFS responds back with a **400 Bad Request** error:

```bash JSON
{
    "message": "Token expired",
    "code": 401
}
```

In your server-side code, implement a mechanism to handle this error and generate a new token, 
in the same way as you did in the previous step.

## Create a client for each business that use your platform

For each client you have in your platform, you need to create a corresponding client within the 
SFS platform. Here, you don't need to duplicate all the information you already have about your 
customers â€“ submit only what's required by SFS. For more information about entities, refer to 
SFS [account structure](/api-reference/structure).

To create a client, make a POST request to the `/api/client` endpoint. 
The request's payload represents details of the client to be created. In the header, specify the `platform Bearer token`:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.sendforsign.com/api/client' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer 123456789' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{ 
		  "data": {
				   "action": "create",
				   "client": {
							  "fullname": "John Johnson",
							  "email": "john_johnson@mail.com",
							  "organization": "Company Inc.",
							  "customKey": "YOUR_COMBINATION"
						     }
				  }
       }'
```

The successful `201 OK` response contains the `clientKey`:

```bash JSON
     {
       "client": {
                "createTime": "2023-12-01 12:18:55",
                "clientKey": "CLIENT_KEY",
                 },
       "code": "201",
       "message": "Client created"
    }
```

## Generate client tokens

A Client token is a specific token issued for an individual platform client. 
These tokens allowing actions to be directly linked to specific client within your platform.

To generate a client token, call `POST /api/token`, and specify the Key of this client in `clientKey` (from the previous step) 
request field, and specify the `platform Bearer token` in the header:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.sendforsign.com/api/token' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer 123456789' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
        "action": "create",
        "clientKey": "YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"
     }'
```

The successful `201 Created` response contains the `access_token` and its validity time (in seconds):

```bash JSON
{
  "access_token": "123456789...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800
}
```

## Handle client token expiry

A partner token is valid only for 1800 seconds (which is 30 minutes). If you will make a request with an expired token, 
SFS responds back with a **400 Bad Request** error:

```bash JSON
{
    "message": "Token expired",
    "code": 401
}
```

In your server-side code, implement a mechanism to handle this error and generate a new token, 
in the same way as you did in the previous step.


Once these steps are completed, you can proceed to the client side setup.
