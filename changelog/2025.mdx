### Dynamic Tables

We've introduced dynamic tables that can be easily created and updated through a single API call. Transform any placeholder in your HTML documents into a fully functional table with just one request.

New features:
- Convert any existing placeholder into a dynamic table
- Define table structure (columns and rows) via API
- Update table content programmatically using `/placeholder/update-table`
- Tables are automatically rendered in the document editor with full editing capabilities

### Introducing Legal AI Agent

ðŸ”¹ E-signatures made contracts digital, but they didn't make them easy.
There's still way too much friction:

- Creating document templates is a pain.
- Filling out the same info over and over? Annoying.
- Fixing errors? Messy.
- Understanding complex legal terms? Feels like you need a law degree.
- Integrating with other software? Ugh.

ðŸ’¡ So we asked: what if AI+API could fix all of this?
That's why we ended up with an API-first approach empowered by AI capabilities.

Today we're introducing the ability to speed up the contract creation process with AI that understands your templates and company data.
