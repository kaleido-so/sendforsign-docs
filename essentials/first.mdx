## Sendforsign templates

The easiest way to draft your contract is to choose from one of our 
templates or simply copy and paste your own template from any source you're using, such as a Word file, 
Notion, Notes, and more.

<Note>
We continuously add new templates, and if you have a specific request or template you'd like 
to see added to our library, please don't hesitate to leave your request 
[here](https://app.kaleido.so/addfeedback/4f0e7587-913e-4779-b214-4c28ca7cb2fe).
</Note>

To get started, select a template from our library:

<Frame caption="Choose a template">
  <img src="/essentials/img/1.png" />
</Frame>

Once a document is created, feel free to make adjustments to its content. Take note of the text 
highlighted in green â€“ these are the areas where you may need to insert your own text:

<Frame caption="Review the highlighted text">
  <img src="/essentials/img/2.jpg" />
</Frame>

When you're ready and satisfied with the text, simply generate your unique sharing link:

<Frame caption="Create a sharing link">
  <img src="/essentials/img/3.jpg" />
</Frame>

There you have it! Your document is now ready for sharing and signing. If you need 
to sign the document first, you can do so using the same sharing link.
