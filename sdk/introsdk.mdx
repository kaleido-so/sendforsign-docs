## React SDK Overview

The SFS React SDK is a collection of pre-built React components that are integrated with the SFS API. 
These components are capable of displaying and interacting with data provided by the API. Platforms can use 
these UI Components to develop React-based web applications for their clients, leveraging the power of the SFS API.

At present, we offer the following components:
