The `Contract Editor` component is a React component that renders the entire Editor. 
The component integrates the functionalities of the `E-signing`, `Approvals` and `Audit Trial` components, 
providing a complete experience throughout the Contract workflow. This component provides the ability to 
create new contracts, open existing contracts, send them for signing, sign, approve, and see the Audit Trial.
